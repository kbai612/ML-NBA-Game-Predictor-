NBA Game Predictor

There's a few goals for this project:
1. Create a model to predict the outcome of NBA games of the current day based off of historical data
2. Store the required data in AWS S3 and utilize webscraping to update the training data with the results of the previous day
3. Calculate the % chance of each team winning for every game for the day
4. Compare this % chance to different sports betting sites
5. Analyze trends over the long terms to determine who gives the best and worst odds

Next Steps:
-Expand the scope of this project to NBA player stats 
-Expand the analysis to look at player props over time
